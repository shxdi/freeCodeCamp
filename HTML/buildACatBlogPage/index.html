          <h3>Cats in life</h3>
          <p>
            This is placeholder text. The assignment says to place lorem ipsum
            but I rather just type until i feel it is around a paragraph in
            size. So ill just type until it begins looking like a long
            paragraph. Already find it hard to think of something useless to
            type. So this is good enough i guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is also placeholder text. Cats. Siamese. British shorthair,
            Maine Coon, Persian, Ragdoll, Sphynx, Abyssinian, American
            shorthair, Burmese, Birman, Scottish Fold, Bombay, Siberian, Russian
            Blue, Turkish Angora, Lions, Tigers, Cougars, Jaguars, Leopards,
            Cheetah, Snow Leopard, Lynx, Bobcat, Clouded Leopard.

          <h3>More About Cats</h3>
          <p>
            They want another blog post, so more typing. It wouldve been easier
            to use lorem ipsum like it said to do. But this also works so ill
            just continue. In the next paragraph i will just list out places
            where cats are found. That should give the next paragraph enough
            text.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is more placholder text that has turned out to be somewhat
            informational. Cats live in many places. Outside, Inside, A house, A
            sewer, A jungle, The mountains, The desert, Every continent except
            Antarctica, Asia, North America, South America, Australia, Islands,
            Europe, Africa, Trees, Ground.
