/*
Given a string that may include some bold text in Markdown, return the equivalent HTML string.

Bold text in Markdown is any text that starts and ends with two asterisks (**) or two 
    underscores (__).
There cannot be any spaces between the text and the asterisks or underscores, but there can be 
    spaces in the text itself.
Convert all bold occurrences to HTML b tags and return the string.
For example, given "**This is bold**", return "<b>This is bold</b>".

Note: The console may not display HTML tags in strings when logging messages. Check the 
    browser console to see logs with tags included.

3. parseBold("**This is not bold **") should return "**This is not bold **".
4. parseBold("__ This is also not bold__") should return "__ This is also not bold__".
5. parseBold("The **quick** brown fox __jumps__ over the **lazy** dog.") should return 
    "The <b>quick</b> brown fox <b>jumps</b> over the <b>lazy</b> dog.".
