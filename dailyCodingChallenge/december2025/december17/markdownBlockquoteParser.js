/*
Given a string that includes a blockquote in Markdown, return the equivalent HTML string.

A blockquote in Markdown is any line that:

Starts with zero or more spaces
Followed by a greater-than sign (>)
Then, one or more spaces
And finally, the blockquote text.
Return the blockquote text surrounded by opening and closing HTML blockquote tags.

For example, given "> This is a quote", return <blockquote>This is a quote</blockquote>.

Note: The console may not display HTML tags in strings when logging messages. Check the 
    browser console to see logs with tags included.
