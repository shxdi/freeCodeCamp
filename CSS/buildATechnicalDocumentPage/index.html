        <p>
          <b>What is CSS?:</b> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language
          used to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS is used for colors,
          background images, layouts and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule:</b> A CSS rule is made up of two main
          parts: a selector and a declaration block. A selector is a pattern
          used in CSS to identify and target specific HTML elements for styling.
          A declaration block applies a set of styles for a given selector or
          selectors.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>Here is the general syntax of a CSS rule:</p>
          <pre>
                <code>
                    selector {
                        property: value;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Inline, Internal, and External CSS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Inline CSS:</b> These styles are written directly within an HTML
            element using the style attribute. Most of the time you will not be
            using inline CSS due to separation of concerns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Internal CSS:</b> These styles are written within the
            <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags inside the head section of an HTML
            document. This can be useful for creating short code examples, but
            usually you will not need be using internal CSS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>External CSS:</b> These styles are written in a separate CSS file
            and linked to the HTML document using the link element in the head
            section. For most projects, you will use an external CSS file over
            internal or inline CSS.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <header><h2>Colors</h2></header>

        <p>
          <b>Color Theory:</b> This is the study of how colors interact with
          each other and how they affect our perception. It covers color
          relationships, color harmony, and the psychological impact of color.
        </p>

        <h3>Color Schemes</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Analogous Color Schemes:</b> These color schemes create cohesive
          and soothing experiences. They have analogous colors, which are
          adjacent to each other in the color wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Complementary Color Schemes:</b> These color schemes create high
          contrast and visual impact. Their colors are located on the opposite
          ends of the color wheel, relative to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Triadic Color Scheme:</b> This color scheme has vibrant colors.
          They are made from colors that are approximately equidistant from each
          other. If they are connected, they form an equilateral triangle on the
          color wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Monochromatic Color Scheme:</b> For this color scheme, all the
          colors are derived from the same base color by adjusting its
          lightness, darkness, and saturation. This evokes a feeling of unity
          and harmony while still creating contrast.
        </p>

        <h3>Different Ways to Work with Colors in CSS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Named Colors:</b> These colors are predefined color names
            recognized by browsers. Examples include blue, darkred, lightgreen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>rgb() Function:</b> RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue — the
            primary colors of light. These three colors are combined in
            different intensities to create a wide range of colors. the rgb()
            function allows you to define colors using the RGB color model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>hsl() Function:</b> HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
            — three key components that define a color.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Hexadecimal:</b> A hex code (short for hexadecimal code) is a
            six-character string used to represent colors in the RGB color
            model. The "hex" refers to the base-16 numbering system, which uses
            digits 0 to 9 and letters A to F.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="the_box_model" class="main-section">
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <header><h2>The Box Model</h2></header>

        <p>
          <b>Definition:</b> In the CSS box model, every element is surrounded
          by a box. This box consists of four components: the content area,
          padding, border, margin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Content Area:</b> The content area is the innermost part of the
          box. It's the space that contains the actual content of an element,
          like text or images.
        </p>

        <h3>Box components</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>padding:</b> The padding is the area immediately after the
            content area. It's the space between the content area and the border
            of an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>border:</b> The border is the outer edge or outline of an element
            in the CSS box model. It's the visual boundary of the element.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>margin:</b> The margin is the space outside the border of an
            element. It determines the distance between an element and other
            elements around it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="flexbox" class="main-section">
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <header><h2>Flexbox</h2></header>

        <p>
          <b>Definition:</b> CSS flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that
          allows you to arrange elements in rows and columns within a container.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Flex Model:</b> This model defines how flex items are arranged
          within a flex container. Every flex container has two axes: the main
          axis and the cross axis.
        </p>

        <h3>The flex-direction Property</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Definition:</b> This property sets the direction of the main axis.
          The default value of flex-direction is row, which places all the flex
          items on the same row, in the direction of your browser's default
          language (left to right or right to left).
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <pre>
                <code>
                    .container {
                        display: flex;
                        flex-direction: column;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h3>The justify-content Property</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Definition:</b> This property aligns the child elements along the
          main axis of the flex container.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <pre>
                <code>
                    .container {
                        display: flex;
                        justify-content: center;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h3>The align-items Property</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Definition:</b> This property is used to distribute items along the
          cross axis. Remember that the cross axis is perpendicular to the main
          axis.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <pre>
                <code>
                    .container {
                        display: flex;
                        align-items: center;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="grid" class="main-section">
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <header><h2>Grid</h2></header>

        <p>
          <b>Definition:</b> CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system used to
          create complex layouts in web pages. Grids will have rows and columns
          with gaps between them. To define a grid layout, you would set the
          display property to grid.
        </p>

        <div class="example">
          <pre>
                <code>
                    .container {
                        display: grid;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          <b>The fr (Fractional) Unit:</b> This unit represents a fraction of
          the space within the grid container. You can use the fr unit to create
          flexible grids.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Creating Gaps Between Tracks:</b> There are three ways to create
          gaps between tracks in CSS grid. You can use the column-gap property
          to create gaps between columns. You can use the row-gap property to
          create gaps between rows. Or you can use the gap shorthand property to
          create gaps between both rows and columns.
